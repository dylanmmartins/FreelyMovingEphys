# FreelyMovingEphys - Preprocessing GUI

## Launching the GUI
In the `DLC-GPU2` conda environment, run `python -m preprocessing`

## Loading an Existing Config File
If a config file already exists and you don't want to change any options prior to running the pipeline, click browse on the 'Welcome' page and select the .json file.

Once the .json file path is selected, all tabs between 'Welcome' and 'Run!' should become unavalible. Enter the 'Run!' tab and click run.
